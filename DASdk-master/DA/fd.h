/**
 * This class manages file descriptors within the event loop context.
 *
 * There are two main components to handling file* descriptors. The
 * 'watch_*()' register a file descriptor to react to events on the
 * descriptor state. The 'on_*()' methods should be overridden to
 * actually handle these changes to the file descriptor's state. For
 * example if you're managing a network connection with a client,
 * invoking 'watch_readable(fd, true)' will cause 'on_readable(fd)' to
 * be called whenever data has been received.
 *
 * Note that it is not necessary to always watch_*() attributes of a
 * file descriptor, that is, you are free to write to a socket even if
 * watch_writeable has not been set. Continuing with the network
 * connection example, on_writeable will be continuously called when
 * 'watch_writeable(fd, true)' is set, as the descriptor is almost
 * always writeable. If the other side of the connection overruns its
 * TCP backlog, though, your descriptor will return an error on write,
 * indicating that the socket is no longer writeable, and it is at
 * that point that 'watch_writeable(fd, true)' should be invoked. When
 * the other end of the connection
